# AWESOME CRAP

## Goal

The goal of this group project was to showcase skills we have learned throughout the course in a collaborative setting, by building a MERN stack application that solves a real-world need, focusing on data and user demand.

## Process

After learning about all of the requirements for this project, the first thing we did as a group was to brainstorm ideas for our app. We landed on the concept of creating an app that provides a place online where the user can search for yard/garage sales in a specific chosen location, as well as post information about their own yard/garage sale(s). We decided to name this app “Awesome Crap”, based on research of exisiting yard sale street signs. At this point, we also discussed how to separate certain tasks, based on what people were comfortable or enjoyed working on. 

We then created the intial file structure for a MERN application, adjusting it along the way to accomodate our needs. A repo was also created on GitHub and everyone was assigned to it as contributors, which allowed us to create individual branches and use git to create pull requests and merge people’s different contributions along the way.  

We worked both individually and as a group. Individually, people worked on certain specific elements of the code and, when together, we could collaborate on how to finish up certain sections we had been working on individually as well. The collaboration was especially important when fixing bugs. Overall, it was a successful group experience, and gave us an idea of what working as a team would be like in a professional environment.

SO THAT I can be better organized when visiting yard sales, as well as reach more people when having my own yard sale

## Future Improvements

As with any app, there is always room for improvements and additions. Given more time, these are just some of the things that could be improved upon or added to our app.  

As more and more yard sales get posted in the Awesome Crap app, it would be useful to have a space where people can chat about specific items or any questions they may have for sellers. It could also have a place where people could buy things on the app itself, and then go pick it up at a later time.  

As the site grows, it could potentially provide a way in which the seller could post a list of specific items they have to offer, making it possible for potential buyers to search for a yard sale based on types of items.  

It could also be useful to incorporate an alert system, so that users get an alert on their devices of upcoming yard/garage sales they have previously saved.
